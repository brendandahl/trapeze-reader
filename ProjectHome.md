_**This project is no longer actively developed.**_
I've joined the Mozilla team and I am now working full time on [pdf.js](https://github.com/andreasgal/pdf.js)

# About #
Trapeze is a pure Javascript/HTML5 PDF reader. Its still largely in alpha but most simple PDFs render correctly.

# Tested Browsers #
  * Chrome
  * Firefox

# Why? #
After wanting to learn more about the new features in HTML5, I decided to try and create a PDF reader entirely in Javascript and HTML5.

# Inspiration #
The project was largely possible do to existing PDF libraries such as [pdf-renderer](https://pdf-renderer.dev.java.net/) and [PDFBox](http://pdfbox.apache.org/)
